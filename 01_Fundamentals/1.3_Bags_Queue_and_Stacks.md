# 1 Stacks (LIFO)
## 1.1 Linked-list implementation

[Linked-list stack](Exercises/1.3%20Bags%20Queue%20and%20Stacks/LinkedListStack.h)

## 1.2 Resizing-array implementation
Resize:
- Double size of array when array is full
- Halve size of array when array is one-quarter full.

The array is always between 25%-100% full

# 2 Queue (FIFO)
## 2.1 Linked-list implementation
Need to modify `topNode` when we push element to an empty queue, and modify `lastNode` when we pop from an empty queue.

## 2.2 Resizing-array implementationResize:
- Reset firstIndex back to 0 and double size of array when array is full
- Reset firstIndex back to 0 and halve size of array when array is one-quarter full.
