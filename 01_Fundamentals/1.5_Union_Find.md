# 1 Dynamic Connectivity
## 1.1 Problem description
Given a set of N objects, we need to implement two commands:
- Union command: connect two objects
- Find/Connected query: Is there a path connecting the two objects?

## 1.2 Modeling the connections
1. We assume that **“is connected to”** is an equivalence relation, which means that it is
   - Reflexive : `p` is connected to `p`.
   - Symmetric : If `p` is connected to `q` , then `q` is connected to `p`.
   - Transitive : If `p` is connected to `q` and `q` is connected to `r` , then `p` is connected to `r`.
  
2. We assume **Connected components** as maximal set of objects that are mutually connected. Any Element of one connected component is **not** connected to elements of other connected components

3. Implementing the operations:
   - Union command: replace components containing two objects with their union (Merge!)
   - Find query: Check if two objwcts are in the same component

4. Goal: Design efficient data structure for union-find

# 2 Quick find (eager approach)
## 2.1 Data structure
- Use integer array `id[]` of size N.
- Interpretation: `id[i]` means the component object `i` belongs to. 
- Find: `p` and `q` are connected if and only if they have the same id.
- Union: Change `id` of all objects with `id[p]` to `id[q]`

## 2.2 Implementation

```cpp
class UF{
public:
    UF(int N) : id(N, 0){
        for (int i = 0; i != N; ++i)
            id[i] = i;
    }
    bool connected(int p, int q) {
        return (id[p] == id[q]);
    }
    // use `connect` instead of `union` because `union` is a C++ keyword
    void connect(int p, int q) {
        int pid = id[p];
        int qid = id[q];
        for (int i = 0; i != id.size(); ++i) {
            if (id[i] == pid)
                id[i] = qid;
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> id;
};
```

## 2.3 Efficiency of Quick Find
- Initialize: N
- Union: N
- Find: 1

Too slow

# 3 Quick union (lazy approach)
## 3.1 Data structure
- Use integer array `id[]` of size N.
- Interpretation: `id[i]` is parent of `i`, parent of unconnected object is itself
- Root of `i` is `id[id[id[...id[i]...]]]` (like a tree)
- Find: `p` and `q` are connected if and only if they have the same root.
- Union: Set `id` of `p`'s root to the id of `q`'s root

## 3.2 Implementation
```cpp
class QuickUnionUF{
public:
    QuickUnionUF(int N) : id(N, 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i != N; ++i)
            id[i] = i;
    }

    bool connected(int p, int q) {
        return (root(p) == root(q));
    }
    // Union
    void connect(int p, int q) {
        id[root(p)] = root(q);
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> id;
    int root(int i) {
        while (id[i] != i)
            i = id[i];
        return i;
    }
};
```
## 3.3 Efficiency of Quick Union
Worst case:
- Initialize: N
- Union: N (includes cost of finding roots)
- Find: N

still too slow

# 4 Weighted quick union
## 4.1 Improvements
- Modify quick union to avoid tall trees
- Keep track of size of each tree (number of objects)
- Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree instead of linking to a node of larger tree. (Make trees flat instead of tall)
